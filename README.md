Data Analysis Practice Notebooks
Welcome to my repository of practice notebooks for data analysis using Python! This collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates various data manipulation, visualization, and analysis techniques with Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and PostgreSQL. Each notebook is designed to provide practical insights and skills for handling real-world data.

Contents
1. Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset
Objective: This project involves analyzing a dataset of restaurant information from Zomato to extract meaningful insights. The analysis covers various aspects such as:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Overview of the dataset, including distribution of ratings, cuisines, and locations.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Visualization: Creating plots to visualize trends and relationships within the data.
Insights: Identifying patterns and key findings related to restaurant performance and customer preferences.

2. US Accidents Dataset
Objective: This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of US traffic accidents to uncover patterns and contributing factors. The analysis includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examination of accident frequencies, types, and locations.
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing data, erroneous entries, and standardizing formats.
Visualization: Generating charts and maps to illustrate accident hotspots and trends.
Insights: Understanding factors influencing accident rates and providing actionable recommendations.
